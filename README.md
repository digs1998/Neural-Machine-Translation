# Machine Translation
**Machine translation is the task of automatically converting source text in one language to text in another language.**

***In a machine translation task, the input already consists of a sequence of symbols in some language, and the computer program must convert this into a sequence of symbols in another language.***

***Given a sequence of text in a source language, there is no one single best translation of that text to another language. This is because of the natural ambiguity and flexibility of human language. This makes the challenge of automatic machine translation difficult, perhaps one of the most difficult in artificial intelligence:***

**The fact is that accurate translation requires background knowledge in order to resolve ambiguity and establish the content of the sentence.**

**Classical machine translation methods often involve rules for converting text in the source language to the target language. The rules are often developed by linguists and may operate at the lexical, syntactic, or semantic level. This focus on rules gives the name to this area of study: Rule-based Machine Translation, or RBMT.**

**RBMT is characterized with the explicit use and manual creation of linguistically informed rules and representations.**

# Workflow of Project
**I have collected Datasets from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/digvijayyadav/frenchenglish)**

**Implementation process, I have refered the [keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/lstm_seq2seq.py) documentation of this**

# Outputs
**Output as well as implementation steps can be found on my Kaggle [implementation](https://www.kaggle.com/digvijayyadav/neural-machine-translation-de-l-anglais-vers-le-f/data#Model-Developement)
